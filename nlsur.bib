	equations is reported which involves application of Aitken's generalized
	least-squares [1] to the whole system of equations. Under conditions
	generally encountered in practice, it is found that the regression
	coefficient estimators so obtained are at least asymptotically more
	efficient than those obtained by an equation-by-equation application
	of least squares. This gain in efficiency can be quite large if "independent"
	variables in different equations are not highly correlated and if
	disturbance terms in different equations are highly correlated. Further,
	tests of the hypothesis that all regression equation coefficient
	vectors are equal, based on "micro" and "macro" data, are described.
	If this hypothesis is accepted, there will be no aggregation bias.
	Finally, the estimation procedure and the "micro-test" for aggregation
	bias are applied in the analysis of annual investment data, 1935-1954,
	for two firms.},

	with the observed expenditure patterns of individual consumers in
	a long time series of expenditure surveys and is also able to provide
	a detailed welfare analysis of shifts in relative prices. A nonparametric
	analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that Engel curves
	require quadratic terms in the logarithm of expenditure. While popular
	models of demand such as the Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand
	Systems do allow flexible price responses within a theoretically
	coherent structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that
	are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive the complete
	class of integrable quadratic logarithmic expenditure share systems.
	A specification from this class is estimated on a large pooled data
	set of U.K. households. Models that fail to account for Engel curvature
	are found to generate important distortions in the patterns of welfare
	losses associated with a tax increase.},

@article{Ray83,
	abstract = {The {\lq}cost of a child{\rq} or, the general equivalence scale as it is more commonly known, is a concept of considerable importance in matters relating to public policy and welfare. It has played a crucial part in numerous theoretical and empirical studies relating to poverty, income distribution, dietary needs, income maintenance programs, supplementary and child benefits and other forms of social security payments in a welfare state, and in assessing the horizontal equity of income taxation. In spite of a long tradition of estimating the scale from observed household budget data, there remain severe problems in estimation and interpretation of the scales. This paper proposes a new methodology for calculating the scale using a framework which is consistent with utility theory and which overcomes the identification problem without having to enforce the arbitrary prior assumptions of recent studies. The proposed method allows easy calculation of not only the basic {\lq}scale{\rq} parameter but also how it varies with price and reference utility. We illustrate the usefulness of the procedure by estimating on U.K. budget data at two different levels of aggregation and employing two sets of quite different functional forms. The results are plausible, compare favourably with one another and, hence, confirm the robustness and usefulness of the proposed procedure.},
